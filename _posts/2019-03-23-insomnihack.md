# Exploit Quest challenge

*To be completed*

This was a different type of challenge, in between regular Escape Rooms/ Geo-caching and CTF. 11 different challenges were scattered nearby the CTF room, and you needed to solve at least 10 of these challenges to be able to recover a code to unlock a safe where you'd find a flag for the Exploit Quest.
The challenges weren't too difficult, but I found this rather long and was happy to complete the task with @IdleWog (mushd00m team).
