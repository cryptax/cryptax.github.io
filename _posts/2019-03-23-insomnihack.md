## Exploit Quest challenge



This was a different type of challenge, in between regular Escape Rooms/ Geo-caching and CTF. 

**11 different challenges** were scattered nearby the CTF room, and you needed to solve at least 10 of these challenges to be able to recover a code to unlock a safe where you'd find a **flag for the Exploit Quest**.

The challenges weren't too difficult, but I found this rather long and was happy to complete the task with @IdleWog (mushd00m team).

### Spot 11

The following image was taped on a desk.

Put this image in front of a mirror and you'd get the following sentence *"A flag is wandering in the air of the Palexpo enclosure"* (Palexpo is the venue for Insomni'hack). Except at first, I read "atm" instead of "air" and so, we went on a chase for all ATMs close to Palexpo. Some organizers didn't understand our sudden urge to find an ATM ;-) 

"In the air". Wifi! Indeed, we quickly located a Wifi with a SSID whose name was one of the 11 codes to figure out.

### Spot 5

The following business card could be found on spot #5.

The name was obviously fake, so we sent an SMS to the guy (no answer), called the phone number (answering machine). In the end, the solution was to try this phone number in **WhatsApp**: the avatar for Rocky Sifredo would show a QR-code. Scan this, and get another code.


*To be completed*
