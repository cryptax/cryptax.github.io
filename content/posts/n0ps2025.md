# Break my stream

## Description

CrypTopia is testing their next gen encryption algorithm. 
We believe that the way they implemented it may have a flaw...

We are given a Python file `main.py`.

## Code analysis

The flag is encrypted with a key, which is selected randomly:

```python
flag = b"XXX"
key = os.urandom(256)
```

The encryption consists in a XOR with a keystream derived from the key:

```python
def encrypt(self, message):
    result = []
    for char in message:
        key = next(self.KeyGenerator)
        ...
        result.append(char ^ key)
    return bytes(result)
```

The keystream is created at initialization. I haven't look in detail at the functions PRGA and KSA, because .. we don't need to :smile:

```python
def __init__(self, key, n=256):
    # this generates a keystream of length n, based on the input key
    # if the key expansion is secure, this is the right way to do it
    # because then, the XOR key has the same length as the message
    # and XOR becomes very secure
    self.KeyGenerator = self.PRGA(self.KSA(key, n), n)
```

The program always show the encrypted flag:

```python
encrypted_flag = CrypTopiaSC(key).encrypt(flag)
..
print(f"Oh, one last thing: {encrypted_flag.hex()}")
```

And then, we can have it encrypt our message. We don't know the key, but we'll have the plaintext and ciphertext of our message.

```python
pt = input("Enter your message: ").encode()
ct = CrypTopiaSC(key).encrypt(pt)
print(ct.hex())
```

The flaw relies on the fact the key is chosen once and for all, and consequently same for the keystream. So we have the *same keystream* to encrypt the flag and to encrypt our message. XOR encryption is secure if the key is long (okay) and only used once (ouch!).

Let's suppose we encrypt a long plaintext (longer than the flag).
Then, we have `ct = pt ^ keystream`. We can work out the keystream:
`keystream = ct ^ pt`. 

Then, we can easily decrypt the encrypted flag: `flag = enc_flag ^ keystream`.

## Solution

We run the program a first time and see that the encrypted flag is, in hex: `5ec5b97e7b2996d72381fd988f2e4483ceac4466412075`. This means the flag is 23 characters long. So, we chose a plaintext of 23 characters (or more).

```python
plaintext = b"12345678901234567890123"
ciphertext = bytes.fromhex("21c7da19356a949a2efd93e78d69258192a72e785e3c3b")
keystream = bytes([p ^ c for p, c in zip(plaintext, ciphertext)])

encrypted_flag = bytes.fromhex("5ec5b97e7b2996d72381fd988f2e4483ceac4466412075")
flag = bytes([c ^ k for c, k in zip(encrypted_flag, keystream)])
print("Recovered flag:", flag.decode())
```

Solution:

```
Recovered flag: N0PS{u5u4L_M1sT4k3S...}
```

# Key Exchange

## Description

We have located a secret endpoint of CrypTopia. If we manage to establish a communication with it, we should be able to get sensitive information!

We are given a source code: `main.py`

## Code analysis

The code implements Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
I have commented the code `main.py` below

``python
def gen_pub_key(size):
    q = number.getPrime(size)
    # searches for p that divides p-1
    k = 1
    p = k*q + 1
    while not number.isPrime(p):
        k += 1
        p = k*q + 1
    # searches for a generator g, order q modulo p
    h = randint(2, p-1)
    g = pow(h, (p-1)//q, p)
    while g == 1:
        h = randint(2, p-1)
        g = pow(h, (p-1)//q, p)
    # return public key pair
    return p, g

def get_encrypted_flag(k):
    # hash the shared secret to have adequate key length for AES
    k = sha256(k).digest()
    iv = get_random_bytes(AES.block_size)
    # read flag file and encrypt
    data = open("flag", "rb").read()
    cipher = AES.new(k, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    padded_data = pad(data, AES.block_size)
    # prefixes IV to ciphertext
    encrypted_data = iv + cipher.encrypt(padded_data)
    return encrypted_data

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # generate public key pair
    p, g = gen_pub_key(N)    
    # a is the private key - chosen randomly
    a = randint(2, p-1)
    # k_a = g^a mod p is the secret to share with the other end
    k_a = pow(g, a, p)
    # show p, then g, then k_a
    sys.stdout.buffer.write(p.to_bytes(N))
    sys.stdout.buffer.write(g.to_bytes(N))
    sys.stdout.buffer.write(k_a.to_bytes(N))
    sys.stdout.flush()
    # read N bytes: k_b = g^b mod p
    k_b = int.from_bytes(sys.stdin.buffer.read(N))
    # compute k = k_b ^ a mod p = g^b^a mod p
    k = pow(k_b, a, p)
    # send encrypted flag
    sys.stdout.buffer.write(get_encrypted_flag(k.to_bytes((k.bit_length() + 7) // 8)))
```

The program initiates its own keys for Diffie-Hellman, then it expects my own secret (k_b) to compute a shared secret k.
Finally, it encrypts the flag with the shared secret.

## Solution

So, this is nearly "not a challenge", but simply implementing Diffie-Hellman on our side!

We need to (1) generate our private key b, (2) compute the shared secret: k=k_a ^ b mod p, and (3) create an AES key from SHA256(k) and (4) decrypt the flag.

We adapt to what the other ends sends us:

1. Read p
2. Read g
3. Read k_a

Those are *bytes*, we convert them to *integers*. Diffie-Hellman works with integers.

4. Generate b
5. Compute k_b
6. Send k_b
7. Compute k
8. Read the flag
9. Decrypt using AES

> I encountered silly issues reading from the socket... because I was only reading 128 bytes, not 1024. Took me a while to see my mistake.

```python
import socket
from random import randint
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import unpad

N = 1024  # Same as server

def main():
    # Connect to the server
    host = '0.cloud.chals.io'
    port = 26625
    
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        s.connect((host, port))
        
        # Receive p, g, and k_a from server - need to receive exactly N bytes each
        p_bytes = b''
        while len(p_bytes) < N:
            chunk = s.recv(N - len(p_bytes))
            if not chunk:
                break
            p_bytes += chunk
            
        g_bytes = b''
        while len(g_bytes) < N:

        print(f"Received g: {hex(g)}")
        print(f"Received k_a: {hex(k_a)}")
        
        # Generate our private key
        b = randint(2, p-1)
        print(f"Generated private key b: {hex(b)}")
        
        # Compute our public key
        k_b = pow(g, b, p)
        print(f"Computed public key k_b: {hex(k_b)}")
        
        # Send our public key to server
        k_b_bytes = k_b.to_bytes(N, 'big')
        s.send(k_b_bytes)
        print(f"Sent {len(k_b_bytes)} bytes for k_b")
        
        # Compute shared secret
        shared_secret = pow(k_a, b, p)
        print(f"Computed shared secret: {hex(shared_secret)}")
        
        encrypted_flag = b''
        s.settimeout(2.0)
        try:
            while True:
                chunk = s.recv(1024)
                if not chunk:
                    break
                encrypted_flag += chunk
        except socket.timeout:
            pass
        
        print(f"Received encrypted flag length: {len(encrypted_flag)}")
        print(f"Encrypted flag (hex): {encrypted_flag.hex()}")
        
        if len(encrypted_flag) < AES.block_size:
            print("Error: Received data is too short to contain IV")
            return
        
        # Decrypt the flag
        # Convert shared secret to bytes (same way as server)
        k_bytes = shared_secret.to_bytes((shared_secret.bit_length() + 7) // 8, 'big')
        print(f"Shared secret bytes length: {len(k_bytes)}")
        print(f"Shared secret bytes (hex): {k_bytes.hex()}")
        
        key = sha256(k_bytes).digest()
        print(f"AES key (hex): {key.hex()}")
        iv = encrypted_flag[:AES.block_size]
        ciphertext = encrypted_flag[AES.block_size:]    
        print(f"IV (hex): {iv.hex()}")
        print(f"Ciphertext length: {len(ciphertext)}")
        print(f"Ciphertext (hex): {ciphertext.hex()}")
        
        if len(ciphertext) % AES.block_size != 0:
            print(f"Warning: Ciphertext length ({len(ciphertext)}) is not a multiple of block size ({AES.block_siz
e})")
        
        # Decrypt
        try:
            cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
            decrypted_padded = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)            
            print(f"Decrypted padded (hex): {decrypted_padded.hex()}")
            # Remove padding
            flag = unpad(decrypted_padded, AES.block_size)
            print(f"Decrypted flag: {flag.decode('utf-8')}")
            # Write flag to file
            with open('decrypted_flag.txt', 'w') as f:
                f.write(flag.decode('utf-8'))
            print("Flag written to decrypted_flag.txt")
            
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Decryption error: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Initially, I wasn't writing the flag to a file, but I immediately recognized in the decrypted flag the PNG header. So I dumped it to a file, and the PNG gave the flag.

# Press Me If You Can

## Description

This is a basic website with a silly button that's moving all the time.

The challenge is to click on it nevertheless.

## Web page analysis

This is the source code of the webpage. Pretty simple. 

``html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Press me if you can</title>
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Mouse+Memoirs&amp;display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
        <script src="script.js" defer></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    <div id="bg">    
    <div class="eyes-container">
        <div class="eye">
            <div class="pupil"></div>
            <div class="blink"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="eye">
            <div class="pupil"></div>
            <div class="blink"></div>
        </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <form method="post">
        <button type="submit" name="submit">Press Me</button>
    </form>

    </body>

</html>
```

The logic behind the flying button is in `script.js`

```javascript
const btn = document.querySelector("button");
...
btn.style.left = endPoint.x + "px";
btn.style.top = endPoint.y + "px";

btn.disabled = true;
...

// Add an event listener for mouse movement
document.addEventListener('mousemove', (event) => {
    const { clientX: mouseX, clientY: mouseY } = event;
    ...
```

## Solution

I first try simply to click on the button, through the developer console (F12):

```javascript
document.querySelector('form').submit();
```

But that doesn't work, probably because it doesn't do the real mouse event, just calls `submit`.

So, I disable the fact the button moves:

```javascript
getEventListeners(window).mousemove.forEach(h => window.removeEventListener("mousemove", h.listener));
const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.style.position = "fixed"; button.style.left = "50%"; button.style.top = "50%";
button.style.transform = "none"; button.disabled = false;
```

And then I click:

```javascript
Well Done. You can validate this challenge with this flag : N0PS{W3l1_i7_w4S_Ju5T_F0r_Fun}
```

As I'm nuts with Javascript, this was achieved with the help of ChatGPT.
