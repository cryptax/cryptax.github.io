    <description><![CDATA[This was a different type of challenge, in between regular Escape Rooms/ Geo-caching and CTF.
11 different challenges were scattered nearby the CTF room, and you needed to solve at least 10 of these challenges to be able to recover a code to unlock a safe where you&rsquo;d find a flag for the Exploit Quest.
The challenges weren&rsquo;t too difficult, but I found this rather long and was happy to complete the task with @IdleWog (mushd00m team).]]></description>
