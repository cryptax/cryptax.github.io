*From time to time, I volunteer at our local Repair Cafe, to repair computers and phones. This is an amazing experience, where I learn lots from other more experienced volunteers. We have a pretty good rate of success, computers that would have ended up in the dustbin.*

**Case 1: Old Laptop, black screen**

Nothing showed on the screen, and the volunteer who handled this one opened it up entirely, and just heated the GPU a little. Then, the laptop was back to normal. This is probably a temporary fix, but so amazing!

**Case 2: 4 year old laptop, black screen**

When powered up, the power button and the keyboard would light up, but that's all. No disk noise, no BIOS.

We disassembled the laptop entirely, removed the battery, removed the cell coin battery on the motherboard and noticed that when we started the computer we were hearing the disk start up.

Another volunteer unsoldered the BIOS chip, re-flashed it, re-soldered it back. And that's it, the computer was back to work!

**Case 3: TV set shuts down after 30 minutes**

After some search on Internet, we noticed a firmware patch which said it was fixing a similar issue. We updated the firmware of the TV, and left it on happily for at least one hour without any problem :)
