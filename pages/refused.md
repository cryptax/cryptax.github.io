*We all talk about our success with pride and joy. Let's not forget we get there because of numerous failures. Here is a personal list of conferences where my submissions have been declined. Sometimes, I feel they were right (topic not mature yet, not in the scope of the conference etc). Sometimes, I was genuinely surprised and still don't understand the decision... but that's the way it is!

## List of declined submissions

- SAS 2020
- CoRIIN 2020
- Black Hat Europe 2019
- Hardwear.io 2019

## Analysis

Incidentally, I feel my submissions are most rejected when I submit a *new / novative topic* with little (or close to none) prior art. This explains why I have more rejections some years (those where I have finished research on a new topic) than others (digging into an already mature topic).

This is quite funny, because most conferences particularly seek for novative talks. My failure very certainly lies in *explaining what is so awesome about it*. *New topics require more explanations*, and it isn't always easy.

Eventually, all my research topics got published after a while. Usually, once a first talk has been accepted on the topic, it raises interest on the matter and it gets far easier for the next ones.
