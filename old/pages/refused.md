*We all talk about our success with pride and joy. Let's not forget we get there because of numerous failures. Here is a personal list of conferences where my submissions have been declined. Sometimes, I feel they were right (topic not mature yet, not in the scope of the conference etc). Sometimes, I was genuinely surprised and still don't understand the decision... but that's the way it is!

## Analysis

Usually, my talks get a higher chance of being accepted when

1. I have already spoken in the conference. This is not surprising: there is always a "risk" for an organizer to accept a paper from a speaker he/she does not know.

2. The topic is extremely new, with little prior art. This is quite ironic because nearly all conferences will claim to seek novative talks. The fact is it is far more difficult to get a new topic accepted, because you need to explain things very well, and obviously, that's difficult.
